# PandoraValidationMacros
macros used in pandora validations at CLIC

Pandora is the pattern recognition and reconstruction algorithm software to identify and reconstruction physics particles
https://github.com/PandoraPFA

these macros test and validate the physics output based on the Pandora particles:
the reconstruction is tested for each particle separately, both their energy and direction
rates of correct identification, misidentification probabilities 

global reconstruction quantities on more complicated events (e.g. total energy, misreconstruction and misclassification) 

collimated deposits of energies (so-called jets) are studied as well

plots and histogram styles are defined in some of these macros as well, performance of regression algorithms is tested.
